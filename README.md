# Lucas Rosinelli Resume

This repository contains the source code to my [resume](https://lucasrosinelli.com/).

It's built with [React](https://reactjs.org/) and based on [Ceevee](https://www.styleshout.com/free-templates/ceevee/) layout.

## Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

- ```shell
  yarn install
  ```
  > Install all dependencies needed.
- ```shell
  yarn start
  ```
  > Runs the resume in the development mode.<br>
  > If not automatically opened, go to your browser and open [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
- ```shell
  yarn run build
  ```
  > Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.
